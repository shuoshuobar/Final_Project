Data Diary

1. Data Collection Process

Objective: Extract restaurant delivery details (name, location, delivery fees, ratings, etc.) from Fantuan's website.

Tool: Playwright for dynamic web scraping.

Challenges

Lazy Loading:

Many restaurants were hidden behind a "Load More" button.

Solution: Used Playwright to continuously click "Load More" until all content was loaded.

Dynamic Class Names:

Data fields were identified by changing class names.

Solution: Inspected the website's DOM to locate consistent classes (.name, .sign, .rate, .stateLabel).

Data Fields Extracted

Raw Fields:

raw_name: Name and location combined.

raw_delivery_info: Delivery time, fee, price, and food type combined.

Processed Fields:

Name

Location

Delivery Time

Delivery Fee

Average Price

Food Type

2. Data Processing

Tool: pandas

Process:

Extracted structured information from raw_name and raw_delivery_info using regex.

Cleaned null or missing values with defaults.

Saved the structured data to fantuan_data.csv.

3. Web Application Implementation

Framework: Flask

Features:

Read the processed CSV data and render it in an HTML table.

Paginate results to show 10 records per page.

Allow navigation between pages.

4. Future Improvements

Real-Time Data Updates:

Automate scraping and CSV updates at regular intervals.

Search and Filter:

Enable users to filter restaurants by name, location, or food type.

Visualizations:

Add charts to show average delivery fees by location or rating distribution.
